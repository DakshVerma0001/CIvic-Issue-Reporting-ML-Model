# data/
Place your images in `data/images/` and annotations in `data/annotations/`.
Recommended formats:
- Detection: COCO JSON in `data/annotations/instances_train.json`
- Classification: CSV mapping `image_id -> semicolon-separated labels`
Keep a `data/splits/` folder with text files listing image ids for train/val/test.
