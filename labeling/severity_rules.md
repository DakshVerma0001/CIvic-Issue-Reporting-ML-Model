# Severity Rules (Objective, short examples)

## pothole
- Low: small/shallow (approx <15 cm diameter or <3 cm depth), not on main carriageway.
- Medium: 15–50 cm or 3–10 cm; may damage 2-wheelers; partially on carriageway.
- High: >50 cm or >10 cm; blocks lane or creates immediate hazard.

## garbage
- Low: small scattered litter not obstructing path/drain.
- Medium: visible pile partly blocking sidewalk/road; may attract pests.
- High: large heap overflowing into road/drain; potential health hazard.

## water_leak
- Low: minor drip or wet patch.
- Medium: persistent leak creating puddles or stream.
- High: burst/major flow causing pooling or roadway flooding.

## broken_light
- Low: single bulb out during daytime area non-critical.
- Medium: multiple lights out or one near crossing reducing night visibility.
- High: major outage or traffic-signal failure causing safety risk.

## tree_fall
- Low: small branch on sidewalk.
- Medium: branch or tree partially blocking path/lane.
- High: tree blocking road or entangled with power lines (dangerous).

## other
- Apply same logic: safety/obstruction/health → increase severity accordingly.
